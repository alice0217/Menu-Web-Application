## Showcase:
I created a menu app on my local host that presents users a variety of menu items they can view, create, modify, and delete. On the main page, the user can see a list of restaurants. The user can add a new restaurant and click on a certain restaurant to view the menu.

On the restaurant's menu page, the user is able to view menu items, create a new menu item, edit and delete a menu item, and change the background image. Every time the user edits, deletes, or add something, the web will flash a message.
