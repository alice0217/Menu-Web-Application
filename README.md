# Menu-Web-Application

## Intro: 
This Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program provided by Udacity introduces the foundations of full stack web development. In this course, I learned how to build my own data-driven web application and how to send data from my server in other forms such as JSON requests. There are four lessons in this course:

### Lesson 1: Working with CRUD 

extract data from a database using Python and use a tool called object-relational mapping (ORM) to manipulate queries as objects in Python 
### Lesson 2: Making a web server

build my first data-driven web application 
### Lesson 3: Developing with frameworks
learn about frameworks and create an applicayion using Flask
### Lesson 4: Iterative Development
